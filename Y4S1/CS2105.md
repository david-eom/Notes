## Lecture 01: Overview

#### § 1.1 Definitions

Internet connects hosts / end systems, which run network applications

Hosts access the Internet through access network

Hosts connect to the access network over physical media (guided vs unguided)

Network core: a mesh of interconnected routers

Data transmitted through network via

* Circuit switching

  End-end resources allocated to source and destination

  Circuit-like performance, no sharing of circuit segments

* Packet switching

  Breaks message into smaller packets of $L$ bits, transmits packet onto the link at transmission rate / bandwidth $R$

  Store and forward: entire packet must arrive at a router before it can be transmitted on the next link

  Routes determined with routing algorithms based on address (source and destination information)

#### § 1.2 Delay, Loss & Throughput

##### Sources of Packet Delay

1. $d_{\text{proc}}$

   Nodal processing delay, check for bit errors

2. $d_{\text{queue}}$

   Queuing delay, time waiting in the buffer for transmission

3. $d_{\text{trans}}$

   Transmission delay, $\displaystyle d_{\text{trans}} = \frac L R$

4. $d_{\text{prop}}$

   Propagation delay, $\displaystyle d_{\text{prop}} = \frac d s$

   $d$: length of physical link

   $s$: propagation speed in medium 

##### Packet Loss

Packets queue in router buffers, which has finite capacity

Packet arriving to full queue will be lost

##### Throughput

How many bits can be transmitted per unit time

Measured for end-to-end communication

#### § 1.3 Protocol Layers

Protocol: defines format and order of messages exchanges and actions taken after messages are sent or received

Internet protocol stack:

1. Application
2. Transport
3. Network
4. Link 
5. Physical

## Lecture 02 & 03: Application Layer

#### § 2.1 Principles of Network Applications

##### Network Application Structure

1. Client-server

   Server provides requested service to client

   Client requests service from server

2. Peer-to-peer (P2P)

   No always-on server, peers directly communicate

   Complex management

##### Transport service

1. Data integrity: reliable data transfer
2. Timing: low delay
3. Throughput: minimum amount of bandwidth to be effective
4. Security

##### Application/Transport Layer Protocols

Application layer protocols define types of messages exchanges, message syntax, message semantics and other rules

Application layer protocols ride on transport layer protocols:

1. TCP: reliable with flow control and congestion control
2. UDP: unreliable without flow control and congestion control

Neither provides timing, throughput or security

#### § 2.2 Web and HTTP

Web page consists of a base HTML file and referenced objects, each object addressable by a URL

HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol, web's application layer protocol, uses TCP as transport service

1. Client initiates TCP connection to server
2. Server accepts TCP connection request from client
3. HTTP messages are exchanged
4. TCP connection closed

##### Versions of HTTP

* Non-Persistent HTTP

  At most one object sent over a TCP connection

  Response time: 2 * round-trip time + file transmission time

  OS overhead for each TCP connection, browsers often open parallel connections

* Persistent HTTP

  Multiple objects an be sent over single TCP connection

##### HTTP Messages

* Request message

```
// request line
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\n

// header lines
Host: www.example.org\r\n
Connection: keep-alive/close\r\n
```

Request method types: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`

Conditional `GET`: don't send object if cache has up-to-date version

Request: `if-modified-since: <date>`

Response: `HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified`

* Response message

```
// status line
HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n

// header lines
Date: <date>\r\n
Content-Length: xxx\r\n
Content-Type: text/html\r\n
```

##### HTTP Messages

HTTP defined to be stateless

Use cookies to help messages carry state

#### § 2.3 Domain Name System (DNS)

Client carries out DNS query to translate between the two ways to identify a host:

* Hostname (`www.example.org`)
* IP address (`xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`)

Stored as resource records `(name, value, type, ttl)`

1. `type = A`

   `name` is hostname, `value` is IP address

2. `type = CNAME` 

   `name` is alias name, `value` is canonical name

3. `type = NS`

   `name` is domain, `value` is authoritative name server

4. `type = MX`

   `name` is email, `value` is name of mail server

##### Hierarchical Database

1. Root servers

   Answers requests for records in root zone

2. Top-level domain (TLD) and authoritative servers

   TLD: com, org, net, edu, sg, uk, jp...

   Authoritative: organisation's own DNS servers

3. Local DNS server

   Acts as proxy, forwards query to hierarchy if answer is not found locally

##### DNS Caching

Name server caches mapping once it learns mapping

Cached entries expire after time-to-live (TTL)

**DNS runs over UDP**, fast but unreliable

Sometimes we send multiple requests

##### DNS Name Resolution

Local DNS, root DNS, TLD DNS, authoritative DNS

* Iterative query: local DNS will query everything
* Recursive query: rarely used in practice

#### § 2.4 Socket Programming

Use `(IP address, port number)` to identify process

Socket: software interface between app processes and transport layer protocols

##### UDP

Unreliable, datagram socket, `recvfrom` / `sendto`

* Sender

  Explicitly attaches destination IP address and port number to each packet

  `socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)`

* Receiver

  Extracts IP address and port number from packet


##### TCP

Reliable, byte stream-oriented socket, `recv` / `send`

Server creates new socket to communicate with a specific client, can talk to multiple clients individually

* Sender

  TCP connection setup

  `socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)`

* Receiver

  Close socket after use

  `accept`


## Lecture 04 & 05: Transport Layer

#### § 4.1 Transport Layer Services

Deliver message between application processes running on different hosts

Sender: breaks app message into segments, pass to network layer

Receiver: reassembles segments into message, pass to app layer

Packet switches: check destination IP address to decide router

#### § 4.2 UDP

UDP is unreliable transmission, adds the following service on top of IP:

* Multiplexing at sender

  Header: source port, destination port, length in bytes, checksum, data

* De-multiplexing at receiver

  1. Checks destination port number in segment
  2. Directs segment to socket with that port number
  3. IP datagrams with the same destination port number will be directed to the same UDP socket (one-to-many)

* Checksum to detect errors

  1. Treat segment as sequence of 16 bit integers
  2. Apply binary addition on every integer
  3. Carry from MSB will be added
  4. Compute 1's complement

#### § 4.3 Reliable Data Transfer

Unreliable network may corrupt, drop, reorder packets, or deliver them after long delay

Reliable data transfer should guarantee delivery, correctness and order

##### 1.0: Perfectly reliable channel

Sender keep sending, receiver keep receiving

##### 2.0: Channel with bit errors

Receiver use checksum to detect bit errors

ACK: receiver tells that packet received is OK

NAK: receiver tells that packet has errors, sender retransmits packet

"Stop-and-wait" protocol

##### 2.1: 2.0 + packet sequence number

2.0's flaw: ACK/NAK might be corrupted

If sender retransmits upon garbled feedback, it might result in retransmission of correctly received packet

To handle duplicates:

* Sender adds sequence number to each packet, retransmits packet if ACK/NAK is garbled
* Receiver discards duplicate packet

0 & 1 for sequence number will be sufficient as we only compare with previous packet

##### 2.2: NAK-free protocol

Receiver includes sequence number, sends ACK for the last packet received

Sender retransmits current packet if duplicate ACK from receiver

##### 3.0: Channel with errors and loss

Assume underlying channel may flip bits, lose packets, incur long delay, but will not re-order packets

To handle packet loss, sender waits a reasonable amount of time for ACK, retransmits after timeout

Receiver must specify sequence number of ACKed packet

#### § 4.4 Pipelined Protocols

RDT 3.0 has low utilisation due to stop-and-wait

Pipelining allows multiple, in-flight, yet-to-be-ACKed packets

Range of sequence numbers must be increased

##### Go-Back-N (GBN)

* Sender

  Up to $N = 2^k$ unACKed packets in pipeline

  If $N = 1$, GBN is essentially RDT 3.0

  Insert $k$-bit sequence number in packet header

  Use sliding window, keep only one timer for oldest unACKed packet

  During timeout, retransmit all packets in the window

* Receiver

  Only ACK packets that arrive in order

  Cumulative ACK, does not matter if previous ACKs not delivered

##### Selective Repeat (SR)

* Sender

  Maintains timer for each unACKed packet

  During timeout, resend packet $n$, restart timer

  During ACK, market packet $n$ as received, advance to the next unACKed sequence number

* Receiver

  Individually ACK correctly received packets

  Buffers out-of-order packets for eventual in-order delivery

#### § 4.5 Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

##### Overview

1. Point-to-point
2. Connection-oriented (handshaking with `SYNbit`)
3. Full duplex service
4. Reliable in-order byte stream

Maximum segment size (MSS) indicates how much app-layer data (excluding header) a TCP segment can carry

##### Sequence Number

Byte number of the first byte of data in a segment

Initial sequence number is randomly chosen

##### ACK Number

ACK up to the first missing byte

$\text{ACK } m$: receiver received all bytes until $m - 1$

Receiver can also piggy back data in feedback packet

##### Timeout Value

Too short: premature timeout and unnecessary retransmissions

Too long: slow reaction to segment loss

TCP computes and updates timeout based on estimated RTT

##### Fast Retransmission

Timeout period is relatively long

If sender receives 4 ACKs for the same segment, sender resends segment even before the timer expires

## Lecture 06 & 07: Network Layer

#### § 6.1 IP Address

##### Overview

IP address is a 32-bit integer to identify a host, associated with a network interface

One host can have multiple IP addresses (e.g. ethernet & WiFi)

Hosts get IP addresses by:

* Manual configuration by system admin

* Automatic assignment by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server

  IP address is renewable and reusable

  1. Host broadcasts "discover"
  2. DHCP responds "offer"
  3. Host requests "request"
  4. DHCP sends "ACK"

Organisation obtain blocks of IP address by buying from registry or renting from ISP

##### Special IP Addresses

`0.0.0.0/8`: non routable meta address

`127.0.0.0/8`: loopback address (localhost)

`10.0.0.0/8` / `172.16.0.0/12` /`192.168.0.0/16`: private address

`255.255.255.255/32`: broadcast address, all hosts on the same subnet receive datagram

##### Subnet

Subnet is network formed by a group of directly interconnected hosts

Classless inter-domain routing (CIDR): `a.b.c.d/x`

Subnet contains $\texttt{2}^{\texttt{32-x}}$ IP addresses in total

Subnet masks are used to determine the subnet that IP address belongs to

Set all subnet prefix bits to `1`s and hosts ID bits to `0`s

##### Hierarchical Addressing

Allows efficient advertisement of routing

If there are multiple matches, longest prefix match is preferred

#### § 6.2 Routing Algorithms

We associate a cost to each link related to bandwidth or congestion

Routing is to find a least cost path between two vertices in graph

We only focus on intra-AS (autonomous systems) routing

##### Link State Algorithms

All routers have complete knowledge of network topology

Use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute least cost path

##### Distance Vector Algorithms

Routers only know physically connected neighbours

Routers exchange local views with neighbours

1. Swap local view vector with direct neighbours
2. Update own local view if a path is cheaper
3. Repeat 1 & 2 until no more changes

$c(x, y)$: cost between routers $x$ and $y$, $\infty$ if not direct neighbours

$d_x(y)$: cost of least cost path from $x$ to $y$ from $x$'s view

Bellman-Ford: $d_x(y) = \min_v\{c(x, v + d_v(y)\}$

##### Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

Implements distance vector algorithm, uses hop count as cost metric

Exchanges routing table every 30 seconds via UDP

If no update from a neighbour router for 3 minutes, assumes neighbour has failed

Insensitive to network congestion, path with lesser hops is always chosen

#### § 6.3 Network Address Translation (NAT)

NAT routers sit on the boundary of local network and does the following:

1. Replace source IP address & port number of outgoing datagram
2. Remember the mapping from old tuple to new tuple
3. Replace source IP address & port number of incoming datagram

Changing of port number is essential since there might be duplicates

Motivations and benefits:

* No need to rent a range of public IP addresses
* All hosts use private IP addresses, can be changed without notifying outside world
* Hosts in local network are not explicitly addressable and visible, added security

#### § 6.4 Internet Protocols

##### IPv4 Datagram Format

20-byte IP header that contains:

1. TTL: number of remaining hops, ensures packet does not circulate forever
2. Upper layer protocol: UDP/TCP
3. Header checksum: only for IP header, not related to packet data
4. Identifier, flag & fragment offset for fragmentation

##### IP Fragmentation

Different links may have different max transfer unit (MTU), which includes IP header

Large IP datagrams are fragmented by routers

Destination hosts will reassemble the packet using IP header fields

* Flag: `1` if there is a subsequent fragment, `0` if it is the last fragment
* Offset: expressed in unit of 8 bytes
* ID: to identify fragments of the same payload

#### § 6.5 Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

Used by hosts and routers to communicate network level information

ICMP messages carried in IP datagrams

ICMP header starts after IP header ($\texttt{type + code + checksum + others}$)

E.g. `ping` to see if we have a connection, `traceroute` to display path

## Lecture 08 & 09: Link Layer

#### § 9.1 Link Layer Services

Sends datagram between adjacent nodes over a single link

Implemented in network interface card (NIC) or on a chip, which covers both link and physical layers

1. Framing

   Encapsulate datagram into frame, add header and tailer

2. Link access control

   Coordinate which node can send frames at a certain point of time

3. Error detection and correction

   Receiver identifies and corrects bit error without retransmission

4. Reliable delivery

   Often used on error-prone links e.g. wireless link

#### § 9.2 Error Detection and Correction

Detection scheme are not 100% reliable

##### 1. Checksum

Used in TCP/UDP/IP

##### 2. Parity Checking

Even parity: choose a bit such that total number of `1` is even

* 1 Dimensional

  Can detect odd number of single bit errors

  However, errors clustered in bursts

* 2 Dimensional

  Parity value for each row and each column

  Can detect and correct single bit errors

  Can detect any two-bit errors

##### 3. Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

$D$: data bits, viewed as binary number

$R$: the $r$-bit CRC

$G$: generator of $r + 1$ bits

* Sender

  Create $X$ by appending $r$ `0`s to $D$

  Find the remainder $y = X \text{ mod } G$ using XOR division

  Transmit $(D, R)$

* Receiver

  Calculate remainder $(D, R) \text{ mod } G$

  If non-zero remainder, error is detected

Easy to implement, powerful error detection

#### § 9.3 Multiple Access Protocols

Collision if node receives multiple signals at the same time

Ideal properties:

1. Collision free
2. Efficient: when only one node wants to transmit, it can send at rate $R$
3. Fairness: when $M$ nodes want to transmit, each can send at rate $R / M$
4. Decentralised: no special node to coordinate transmissions

##### Channel Partitioning Protocols

1. Time division multiple access (TDMA)

   Access to channel in rounds

   Each node gets fixed length time slots in each round

   * Efficiency: maximum rate is $R / N$

2. Frequency division multiple access (FDMA)

   Channel spectrum divided into bands

   * Efficiency: maximum rate is $R / N$

##### Taking-Turns Protocols

1. Polling

   Master node polls each nodes in round-robin fashion

   * Efficiency: overhead of polling
   * Centralised: master node is single point of failure

2. Token passing

   Special token frame passed from one node to the next

   Node holds onto the token and sends up to a maximum number of frames

   * Efficiency: overhead of token passing
   * Complicated, token loss/node failure can be disruptive

##### Random Access Protocols

No a priori coordination, but need to detect and recover from collisions

1. Slotted ALOHA

   All frames are $L$ bits, time divided into slots of $L / R$

   Nodes start to transmit at the beginning of a slot

   If collision, retransmit in the subsequent slots with probability $p$ until success

   * Has collisions
   * Efficiency: efficient when only one node is active, but maximum 37%, slots wasted due to collision and empty

2. Pure ALOHA

   No time slots, nodes transmit immediately

   If collision, wait for 1 frame transmission time, retransmit with probability $p$ until success

   Chance of collision increases due to bigger window of vulnerability

   * Efficiency: efficiency when only one node is active, but maximum 18%, slots wasted due to collision and empty

3. Carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)

   Listen before transmit

   If channel sensed busy, defer transmission

   * Has collisions: propagation delay

4. CSMA collision detection (CSMA/CD)

   Fix design flaw of CSMA: aborts transmission when collision is detected

   Fix design flaw of ALOHA: use binary exponential backoff

   After $m^\text{th}$ collision, choose $K$ at random from $\{0, 1, \dots, 2^m-1\}$ since more collisions imply heavier load

   Propagation delay has to be smaller than transmission delay

   If frame size is too small, collisions might not be detected

#### § 9.4 Link Layer Addressing

##### MAC Address

Every NIC has a 48-bit MAC address, globally unique

When adapter receives a frame, it checks if destination MAC address matches its own MAC address

If yes, extracts; if no, discards

Broadcast address: `FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF`

IP: postal address	MAC: NRIC number

##### Ethernet

One of the technologies for local area network (LAN)

Unreliable since receiving NIC doesn't send ACK packets

$\texttt{[preamble|dest|src|type|data|CRC]}$

* Preamble

  7B of AA (`10101010`), 1B of AB (`10101011`), aka start of frame

  Used to synchronise receiver and sender clock rates

* Type

  Higher layer protocol

* Data

  Maximum 1500: link MTU

  Minimum 46B: ensure collision is always detected

Topology

1. Bus

   Broadcast, all nodes can collide with each other

   -ve: If back bone cable damaged, entire network fails

   -ve: Difficult to troubleshoot problems

   -ve: Slow for larger networks due to collisions

2. Star

   * Hub

     Physical layer device, works on bit

     Recreates, boosts, and transmits onto all interfaces

     +ve: Cheap and easy to maintain

     -ve: Slow for larger networks due to collisions 

   * Switch

     Elaborated in section below

#### § 9.5 Switches

Link layer device, works on frame

Examine incoming ethernet frame's MAC address, stores and forwards

Use CSMA/CD to access link

Transparent to hosts, plug-and-play

Switches can be connected in hierarchy

##### Self Learning

Each switch has a switch table `<MAC addr|interface|TTL>`

Switch learns, filters and selectively forwards / boradcasts

1. Record incoming link & MAC source of sending host
2. Index switch table with MAC destination
3. If entry found:
   1. If interface is identical to arriving interface, drop the frame
   2. If not, forward frame on interface indicated by entry
4. If not, forward on all interfaces except arriving interface

#### § 9.6 Address Resolution Protocol

Each IP node has an ARP table `<IP addr|MAC addr|TTL>`

ARP is plug-and-play

Suppose $A$ wants to send to $B$

##### Same Subnet

1. $A$ knows $B$'s MAC from ARP table

   Create frame with $B$'s MAC

   Only $B$ will process, other nodes will discard

2. $A$ does not know $B$'s MAC

   $A$ broadcasts ARP query packet containing $B$'s IP address

   Destination MAC set to broadcast address

   Only $B$ will process and reply to $A$ with $B$'s MAC

   $A$ caches $B$'s MAC address in its ARP table until TTL expires

##### Another Subnet

1. $A$ creates IP datagram with source $A$, destination $B$
2. $A$ creates link layer frame with router's MAC
3. Router forwards datagram with IP source $A$, destination $B$
4. Link layer does not care after 1 hop

## L10: Network Security

#### § 10.1 Introduction

1. Confidentiality

   Only sender and intended receiver should understand message content

2. Authentication

   Sender & receiver can confirm identity of each other

3. Message integrity

   Sender & receiver can ensure message is not altered without detection

4. Access and availability

   Services must be accessible and available to users

#### § 10.2 Principles of Cryptography

##### Types of Attacks

1. Ciphertext only
2. Known plaintext
3. Chosen plaintext

##### Symmetric Key Cryptography

$K_A = K_B$

Drawback: requires sender & receiver to agree on a key

1. Ceasar's cipher

   25 possible keys, easy to break

2. Monoalphabetic cipher

   $26!$ possible keys, breakable with statistical analysis

3. Polyalphabetic encryption

   Use $n$ substitution ciphers $C_1, C_2, \dots, C_n$, define cycling pattern

4. Block cipher (DES/AES)

   Encrypted in blocks of $K$ bits

   One-to-one mapping for a block

   $2^K$ possible keys

##### Asymmetric (Public) Key Cryptography

$K_A \neq K_B$

Sender use public key, receiver use private key

$m = K_B^-(K_B^+(m)) = K_B^+(K_B^-(m))$

Factoring a big number is hard

RSA:

1. Choose two large prime numbers $p, q$
2. Compute $n = pq$, $z = (p - 1)(q - 1)$
3. Choose $e < n$ that is co-prime with $z$
4. Choose $d$ such that $ed - 1$ is divisible by $z$ ($ed \text{ mod } z = 1$)
5. $K_B^+ = (n, e)$, $K_B^- = (n, d)$
6. Encryption: $c = m^e \text{ mod } n$
7. Decryption: $m = c^d \text{ mod } n$

RSA is computationally intensive, it is combined with DES in practice

1. Select $K_S$
2. Use RSA to transfer $K_S$
3. Use $K_S$ as symmetric key in DES

#### § 10.3 Message Integrity and Signatures

Error detection schemes (checksum, parity, CRC) are not attack proof, easy to find another message with the same value

##### Cryptographic Hash Function

Generate short, fixed-length digests

A small change in input should result in a large change in the output

Computationally infeasible to find $x, y$ such that $H(x) = H(y)$

##### Message Authentication Code

Sending $(m, H(m))$ does not ensure integrity, since the attacker can replace with $(m', H(m'))$

To ensure integrity, sender and receiver share authentication key $s$

Send $(m, H(m + s))$ instead

##### Digital Signatures

Signatures must be:

1. Verifiable: recipient can check if signature and message was generated by sender
2. Unforgeable: no one other than sender should be able to generate the signature

Procedure:

1. Sender compute $H(m)$
2. Sender encrypt with $K_B^-(H(m))$
3. Receiver decrypt with $K_B^+(K_B^-(H(m)))$
4. Receiver compute $H(m)$
5. Receiver compare results

##### Public Key Certification

Create certification authority (CA) that maintains everyone's public key, CA signs its messages to prevent intercepted communication

Maintain a list of CAs trusted a priori (root CA)

#### § 10.4 Firewalls

Isolates internal net from larger internet

Allows some packets to pass, blocks others

##### Advantages of Firewalls

1. Prevent denial of service (DoS) attack
2. Prevent illegal modification/access of internal data
3. Allow only authorised access

##### Limitations of Firewalls

1. IP spoofing
2. Can become bottleneck
3. Tradeoff with degree of communication with outside

##### Types of Firewalls

1. Stateless packet filters

   Filter packet-by-packet based on

   * Source/Destination IP address & port number
   * ICMP message type
   * TCP SYN & ACK bits

   Checked against access control lists (ACL), applied top to bottom

2. Stateful packet fileters

3. Application gateways

## L11: Multimedia Networking

#### § 11.1 Multimedia Networking Applications

1. Streaming stored audio/video
2. Conversational voice/VoIP ("two-way live")
3. Streaming live audio/video ("one-way live")

##### Video

* Spatial coding: redundancy within image

* Temporal coding: redundancy between images

* Constant bit rate (CBR): encoding rate fixed

  Not responsive to the complexity of the video

  Suited for real-time live streaming

* Variable bit rate (VBR): encoding rate changes as spatial & temporal coding changes

  Suited for on-demand video

##### Audio

Each sample quantised, each quantised value represented by bits

#### § 11.2 Streaming Stored Video

Streaming: can begin layout before downloading the entire file

Stored: can transmit faster than rendered (buffering at client)

##### Buffering

Once playout begins, playback must match original timing, but network delays are variable

Use buffering and playout delay to compensate jitter

$x(t)$: buffer fill rate

$Q(t)$: buffer fill level

$r$: playout rate

$B$: buffer size

1. Fill buffer until playout begins at $t_p$
2. $Q(t)$ varies as $x(t)$ varies and $r$ is constant
3. $\bar{x} < r$: buffer eventually empties and causes freezing
4. $\bar{x} > r$: buffer will not empty

Playout delay:

* Pro: buffer starvation is less likely
* Con: larger delay until user begins watching

##### Streaming with UDP

Push-based streaming

Server send at rate appropriate for client

Video chunks encapsulated using RTP (sequence number, timestamp, video encoding)

Short playout delay to remove network jitter

* Drawbacks
  * Need separate media control server e.g. RSTP
  * UDP may not go through firewalls

##### Streaming with HTTP/TCP

Pull-based streaming

File retrieved via HTTP GET

Send at maximum possible rate under TCP

* Advantages
  * Passes more easily through firewalls
  * Network infrastructures are fine-tuned for HTTP/TCP
* Drawbacks
  * Fill rate fluctuates due to TCP congestion control
  * TCP has sawtooth when probing for bandwidth

#### § 11.3 Voice over IP (VoIP)

Speaker's audio packets generated only during talk spurts

Higher delays are noticeable, but IP is a best-effort service with no upper bound on delay or percentage of packet loss

##### Fixed Playout Delay

Receiver attempts to play each chunk exactly $q$ ms after chunk was generated

Every chunk contains sequence number and timestamp

* Chunk has timestamp $t$: playout at $t + q$
* Chunk arrives after $t + q$: too late, deemed as lost

Tradeoff in choosing $q$:

* Large $q$: less packet loss
* Small $q$: better interactive experience

##### Adaptive Playout Delay

Estimate network delay, adjust layout delay at the beginning of each talk spurt

Silent periods are compressed and elongated

Use exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA)

* $\text{playout}_i = t_i + d_i + 4 v_i$
* $d_i = (1 - \alpha) d_{i - 1}+ \alpha (r_i - t_i)$
* $v_i = (1 - \beta) v_{i - 1} + \beta |r_i - t_i - d_i|$

##### Recovery from Packet Loss

Using ACK/NAC is too slow, use forward error correction (FEC) instead

1. Simple FEC

   For every $n$ chunks, create redundant XOR chunk

   Can recontstruct if at most one chunk is lost

   Bandwidth increases by $1/n$

   Playout delay increased to $n + 1$ chunks

2. Piggyback FEC

   Send lower resolution audio stream as redundant information

3. Interleaving

   Packet contains small unit from different chunks

   If packet lost, still have most of the original chunk

#### § 11.4 Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH)
