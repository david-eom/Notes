## Lecture 01: Nash Equilibria and Game Theory Basics

#### • Normal Form Games

Players $N = \{1, \dots, n\}$

Player $i \in N$ has possible actions $A_i$

Action profile: ${\stackrel{\rightarrow}{a}} = A_1 \times A_2 \times \dots \times A_n = A$

Utility of player $i$: $u_i({\stackrel{\rightarrow}{a}}), {\stackrel{\rightarrow}{a}} \in A$

#### • Pure Nash Equilibrium

Given everyone else's actions ${\stackrel{\rightarrow}{a}_{-i}}$

Best response set of $i$: $\text{BR}_i({\stackrel{\rightarrow}{a}_{-i}}) = \{b \in A_i | b \in \text{argmax} \, u_i({\stackrel{\rightarrow}{a}}_{-i}, b)\}$

Pure Nash equilibrium: $\forall i \in N, a_i \in \text{BR}_i({\stackrel{\rightarrow}{a}}_{-i})$

#### • Mixed Nash Equilibrium

Mixed Nash equilibrium always exists

Instead of choosing single action, player can play a random mix of them ${\stackrel{\rightarrow}{p_i}} \in \Delta(A_i)$, but must be in between 0 and 1

Mixed strategy profile: ${\stackrel{\rightarrow}{p}} = ({\stackrel{\rightarrow}{p_1}}, \dots, {\stackrel{\rightarrow}{p_n}}) \in \Delta(A_1) \times \dots \times \Delta(A_n)$

Utility of player $i$: $\displaystyle u_i({\stackrel{\rightarrow}{p}}) = \sum_{{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{a} \in A}} u_i({\stackrel{\rightarrow}{a}})\Pr[{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{a}}]$

Mixed Nash equilibrium: $\forall i \in N, \forall {\stackrel{\rightarrow}{q_i}} \in \Delta(A_i), u_i({\stackrel{\rightarrow}{p}}) \geq u_i({\stackrel{\rightarrow}{p}}_{-i}, {\stackrel{\rightarrow}{q_i}})$

#### • Computing Nash Equilibrium

1. Compute all NE in which at least one player plays a pure strategy
2. Compute all NE in which both players mix between both strategies (each player must be **indifferent** between two strategies)

#### • Dominant strategy

${\stackrel{\rightarrow}{p}} \in \Delta(A_i)$ dominates ${\stackrel{\rightarrow}{q}} \in \Delta(A_i)$

If $\forall {\stackrel{\rightarrow}{p}}_{-i} \in \Delta(A_{-i}), \, u_i({\stackrel{\rightarrow}{p}}_{-i}, {\stackrel{\rightarrow}{p}}) \geq u_i({\stackrel{\rightarrow}{p}}_{-i}, {\stackrel{\rightarrow}{q}})$

Strict domination: change $\geq$ to $>$

If action $a \in A_i$ is **strictly** dominated by some strategy ${\stackrel{\rightarrow}{p}} \in \Delta(A_i)$, then action $a$ is never played

## Lecture 03: Auctions

#### • Single Item Auctions

Single item for sale, each bidder $i \in N$ values item at $v_i$

##### English Auction

Auctioneer sets starting price, bidders take turns raising bids, last bid wins

Winning bid is either $v_\max$ or $v_\max + \delta$

##### Japanese Auction

Auctioneer sets starting price, start raising it

Bidders can drop out and cannot return once he dropped

Less communication than English auction

##### Dutch Auction

Auctioneer sets high starting price and starts lowering it

Auction ends when some bidder accepts the price

##### Sealed-Bid Auction

All bidders simultaneously submit their bids, highest bidder wins and pays his bid

##### Vickrey (Second-Price) Auction

All bidders submit bids simultaneously, highest bidder wins and pays second highest price

$n$ players, player values object at $v$, second highest bid is $p$

Payoff is $v - p$ if he gets the object, $0$ if he does not get the object

Easy to implement, computationally efficient, but bidders must trust auctioneer

To prove that in a Vickrey auction, truthful bidding is a dominant strategy:

1. Case 1: $v \geq b_{n-1}$

   If you bid $b \geq b_{n-1}$, you win, payoff is $v - b_{n-1}$, same as truthfully reporting

   If you bid $b < b_{n-1}$, you lose, payoff is $0$

2. Case 2: $v < b_{n - 1}$

   If you bid $b \geq b_{n-1}$, you win, payoff is $v - b_{n-1} < 0$

   If you bid $b < b_{n-1}$, you lose, payoff is $0$, same as truthfully reporting

#### • Multi Unit Auctions

$k \leq n$ identical items for sale, each bidder $i \in N$ wants one item, values item at $v_i$

Outcomes $O = o_1, \dots, o_m$

Each player has a utility function $v_i: O \to \R$

We can assign payment $\pi_1, \dots, \pi_n$, utility is then $u_i(o) = v_i(o) - \pi_i$

We choose an outcome $o^\ast$ to maximise some function e.g. $\displaystyle \sum _i u_i(o^\ast)$

Incentive compatibility: reporting your true valuations is a Nash equilibrium

Dominant strategy incentive compatibility: reporting your true valuations is a weakly dominant strategy

##### Vickrey Clarke Groves (VCG) Mechanism

Selects socially optimal outcome, ensures truthful reporting is a dominant strategy by payment design

* Choose outcome $o^\ast$ that maximises $\displaystyle \sum_i v_i(o^\ast)$
* Each agent pays externality that she imposes on other agents
  * Pretend $j$ does not exist, choose $o^\ast_{-j}$ that maximises $\displaystyle \sum _{i \neq j} v_i(o_{-j})$
  * $j$ pays $\displaystyle \sum_{i \neq j} v_i(o^\ast_{-j}) - \sum_{i \neq j} v_i(o^\ast)$

When $j$  reports truthfully: $\displaystyle v_j(o^\ast) - \left( \sum_{i \neq j} v_i(o^\ast_{-j}) - \sum_{i \neq j} v_i(o^\ast) \right) = \sum_i v_i(o^\ast) - \sum_{i \neq j} v_i(o^\ast_{-j})$

First term optimal total social welfare, second term does not depend on $j$

When $j$ misreports: $\displaystyle v_j(o') - \left( \sum_{i \neq j} v_i(o^\ast_{-j}) - \sum_{i \neq j} v_i(o') \right) = \sum_i v_i(o') - \sum_{i \neq j} v_i(o^\ast_{-j})$

First term at most optimal total social welfare, second term does not depend on $j$

#### • Combinatorial Auctions

$m$ items for sale, $(n + 1)^m$ possible outcomes, bidders have valuations for different subset of items 

Challenges:

1. Preference elicitation: each bidder has $2^m$ private parameters
2. Computational issues: NP-hard to find optimal outcome
3. Revenue non-monotonicity

## Lecture 04: Facility Location & Routing Games

#### • Facility Location

Players: $N = \{1, \dots, n\}$, each with location $x_i$

Total cost: $\displaystyle \sum_{i \in N} \left| f\left(\vec{x}\right) - x_i \right|$

Max cost: $\displaystyle \max_i \left| f\left(\vec{x}\right) - x_i \right|$

1. Midpoint mechanism

   Minimise max cost to $\displaystyle \frac{x_1 + x_n}{2}$

   Not truthful, agent 1 will report a lower $x_1$

2. Median mechanism

   Socially optimal, total cost would increase if shift by $\epsilon$

   Truthful

3. Leftmost mechanism

   Max cost approximation: $2$

   Truthful

4. Randomised mechanism

   $\displaystyle\Pr(x_1) = \Pr(x_n) = \frac{1}{4}$

   $\displaystyle \Pr\left(\frac{x_1 + x_n}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{2}$

   Max cost approximation: $\displaystyle \left(\frac{1}{4} \times d + \frac{1}{4} \times d + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}d \right) \div \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{3}{2}$

   Proof of truthfulness:

   * In order for mechanism to change anything, either $x_1$ or $x_n$ has to be changed
   * Leftmost player has no incentive to report to either right (obviously) or left
   * Cost: $\displaystyle \frac{1}{4} \cdot d$ (if $x_1$ is chosen)
   * Benefit: $\displaystyle \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{d}{2}$ (if midpoint is chosen)

Any deterministic truthful mechanism has max-cost approximation ratio of at least $2$

Any randomised truthful mechanism has max-cost approximation ratio of at least $\displaystyle \frac{3}{2}$

#### • Routing

##### Non-atomic

One unit of traffic routed from $s$ to $t$

1. Pigou's Example

   Top edge: $c(x) = 1$

   Bottom edge: $c(x) = x$

   Dominant strategy: bottom edge

2. Braess' Paradox

   Top edge: $c(x) = x, \, c(x) = 1$

   Bottom edge: $c(x) = 1, \, c(x) = x$

   Connecting edge: $c(x) = 0$

   Dominant strategy: top, connecting, bottom

##### Atomic

$k$ units of traffic, $k$ is a positive integer, each unit must be routed as a whole

In atomic routing game, a pure Nash equilibrium flow always exist

##### Price of Anarchy

Selfish behaviour hurts social welfare

$\displaystyle \text{PoA}(G) = \frac{\text{Worstnash}(G)}{\text{OPT}(G)}$

## Lecture 05 & 06: Cooperative Games

#### • Definitions

Players: $N = \{1, \dots, n\}$

Valuation function $v: 2^N \to \R_{\geq 0}$, mapping form all subset of players to a value

$v(S)$: value of coalition $S$, $v(\emptyset) = 0$

$\text{CS}$: coalition structure, a partition of $N$

$\displaystyle \text{OPT}(\mathcal{G}) = \max_{\text{CS}} \sum_{S \in \text{CS}}v(S)$

E.g.:

1. Induced subgraph games

   Given a weighted graph, players are nodes

   $v(S)$: total edge weights

2. Network flow games

   Given a weighted directed graph, players are edges

   $v(S)$: maximum flow from $s$ to $t$

3. Weighted voting games

   Given a list of weights and threshold $(w_1, \dots, w_n; q)$

   $v(S)$: $1$ if total weight $\geq q$

##### Payoff Properties

* Efficiency: $\vec{x} \in \R_{\geq 0}^n$ such that $\displaystyle \sum_{i \in N}x_i = v(N)$
* Individual rationality: $\forall i \in N, \, x_i \geq v(\{i\})$
* Imputation: vector satisfying efficiency and individual rationality

##### Game Properties

* Monotone

  For $S \subseteq T \subseteq N, \, v(S) \leq v(T)$ (Having more players does not hurt)

* Simple

  $\forall S, \, v(S) \in \{0, 1\}$

* Superadditive

  For disjoint $S, T \subseteq N, \, v(S) + v(T) \leq v(S \cup T)$

* Convex

  For $S \subseteq T \subseteq N, \, i \in N \backslash T, \, v(S \cup \{i\}) - v(S) \leq v(T \cup \{i\}) - v(T)$

  (If player joins a larger set, marginal gain at least higher than smaller set)

#### • The Core

An imputation is in the core if:

* $\displaystyle \forall S \subseteq N, \, \sum_{i \in S} x_i = x(S) \geq v(S)$
* $\displaystyle \sum_{i \in N} x_i = v(N)$

Each subset getting at least what it can make on its own, no subset can deviate

##### Theorems about Empty Core

1. Simple game

   $\text{Core}(\mathcal{G}) \neq \emptyset \Longleftrightarrow \mathcal{G}$ has veto players

   Core distributes payoff only among veto players

   (Some veto players might still get 0 as payoff)

2. Induced subgraph game

   $\text{Core}(\mathcal{G}) \neq \emptyset \Longleftrightarrow$ the graph has no negative cut

   * To prove $\Longleftarrow$:

     Consider the payoff $\displaystyle \phi_i = \frac 1 2 \sum_{j \in N} w(i, j)$

     $\displaystyle \begin{aligned} \phi(S) &= \sum_{i \in S} \phi_i = \sum_{i \in S} \sum_{j \in N} \frac 1 2 w(i, j) \\ &=  \sum_{i \in S} \sum_{j \in S} \frac 1 2 w(i, j) +  \sum_{i \in S} \sum_{j \in N \backslash S} \frac 1 2 w(i, j) \\ &= v(S) + \frac 1 2 \text{Cut}(S, N \backslash S) \geq v((S))  \end{aligned}$

     $\phi(N) = v(N)$ is trivial since we can just set $S = N$

   * To prove $\Longrightarrow$:

     Suppose there is a negative cut between $S$ and $N$
     
     I.e. $\displaystyle \sum_{i \in S} \sum_{j \in N \backslash S} w(i, j) < 0$
     
     Take any $\vec{x}$ satisfying efficiency, and using the same definiton for $\phi_i$
     
     $\displaystyle \begin{aligned} x(S) + x(N \backslash S) &= \sum_{i \in N}x_i = v(N) = \phi(N) \\ &= \phi(S) + \phi(N \backslash S) \end{aligned}$
     
     $\displaystyle \begin{aligned} & x(S) - v(S) + x(N \backslash S) - v(N \backslash S) \\ =\,& \phi(S) - v(S) + \phi(N \backslash S) - v(N \backslash S) \\ =\,& \sum_{i \in S} \sum_{j \in N \backslash S} \frac 1 2 w(i, j) + \sum_{i \in N \backslash S} \sum_{j \in S} \frac 1 2 w(i, j) \\ =\,& \text{Cut}(S, N \backslash S) < 0 \end{aligned}$
     
     Either $x(S) < v(S)$ or $x(N \backslash S) < v(N \backslash S)$, cannot be in core

#### • The Shapley Value

The only value satisfying efficiency, linearity, dummy, symmetry is the Shapley Value

* Efficiency: $\displaystyle \sum_{i \in N} \phi_i = v(N)$
* Symmetry: $\forall A, \, v(A \cup \{i\}) = v(A \cup \{j\}), \, i, j \not \in A$, symmetric players are paid equally
* Dummy: $\forall A, v(A \cup \{i\}) = v(A), \, i \not \in A$, dummy players are not paid
* Linearity: $\phi_i(\mathcal{G}_1) = \phi_i(\mathcal{G}_2) = \phi_i(\mathcal{G}_1 + \mathcal{G}_2), \, \phi_i(a \cdot \mathcal{G}_1) = a \cdot \phi_i(\mathcal{G}_1)$

##### Computing the Shapley Value

1. Given player $i$, set $S \subseteq N$

   Marginal contribution of $i$ to $S$, $m_i(S) = v(S \cup \{i\}) - v(S)$

2. Given permutation $\sigma \in \Pi(N)$

   Predecessors of $i$ in $\sigma$, $P_i(\sigma) = \{j \in N | \sigma(j) < \sigma(i) \}$

   We write $m_i(\sigma) = m_i(P_i(\sigma))$

3. $\displaystyle \text{Sh}_i = \mathbb{E}[m_i(\sigma)] = \frac{1}{n!} \sum_{\sigma \in \Pi(N)} m_i(\sigma)$

* Weighted Voting Games

  Count the # permutations in which player $i$ is the pivotal player

* Induced subgraph games

  $\displaystyle m_i(S \subseteq N \backslash \{i\}) = \sum_{j \in S} w(i, j)$

  Let $I(j \in P_i(\sigma))$ be the i.r.v for $j$ appears before $i$ in $\sigma$

  $\displaystyle \begin{aligned} &\mathbb{E}_\sigma[v(P_i(\sigma) \cup \{i\}) - v(P_i(\sigma))] \\ =\,& \mathbb{E}_\sigma\left[\sum_{j \in P_i(\sigma)}w(i, j)\right] \\ =\,& \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{j \in N \backslash \{i\}} I(j \in P(\sigma)) \cdot w(i, j) \right] \\ =\,& \sum_{j \in N \backslash \{i\}} w(i, j) \cdot \mathbb{E}[I(j \in P(\sigma))] \\ =\,& \sum_{j \in N \backslash \{i\}} \frac{1}{2} w(i, j)  \end{aligned}$

## Lecture 07: Stable Matching and Nash Bargaining Solution

#### • Stable Matching

##### What Makes for a Good Market

1. Thick: many buyers and sellers, everyone is aware of their options
2. Timely: not too fast (time to weigh out decisions) and not too slow (offers processed quickly, new offers arrive quickly)
3. Safe: does not hurt to reveal preference, outcomes are fair, people are better off by participating

##### Resident Matching Problem

Students $S = \{s_1, \dots, s_n\}$	Hospitals $H = \{h_1, \dots, h_m\}$

For simplicity, $n = m$ as we can insert dummy students/hospitals

Each $s \in S$ has a strict preference order over $H$ ($\succ_s$)

Each $h \in H$ has a strict preference order over $S$ ($\succ_h$)

Matching $M: S \to H$

Blocking pair $(s, h) \in S \times H$: $h \succ_s M(s)$ and $s \succ_h M^{-1}(h)$

A matching is stable if there re no blocking pairs

A stable matching always exists and can be found in polynomial time

#### • Deferred Acceptance Algorithm

##### Description

Start with all students unassigned

Each unassigned student proposes to his favourite not-yet-to-proposed-to hospital

Each hospital picks its most preferred student from the current assigned student and newly proposed student

Truthful for students, untruthful for the hospitals

##### Properties

1. Algorithm terminates in at most $n^2$ iterations, since no student proposes to the same hospital twice

2. Everyone will be matched

   If not, some student is rejected from all $n$ hospitals

   A hospital only rejects in favour of a better student

   Once a hospital is matched, it remains matched, hence all hospitals must be matched

3. Final matching is stable

   Consider $s$ and $h$ that are not matched to each other

   * Case 1: $s$ never proposed to $h$

     Since $s$ goes down his preference list, he is matched to a better hospital

   * Case 2: $s$ proposed to and get rejected by $h$

     $h$ is matched to a better student

##### Fairness

Valid: exists some stable matching such that $M(s) = h$

$\text{best}(s)$: most highly-ranked valid hospital for $s$

$\text{worst}(h)$: least highly-ranked valid hospital for $h$

To prove that algorithm assigns $s \in S$ to $\text{best}(s)$:

1. Assume that this not the case, let $s$ be the first student rejected by $\text{best}(s) = h$
2. Suppose $s$ ends up matching to $h'$ (hence $h \succ_s h'$), because $h$ rejected $s$ for a better student $s'$ (since $s' \succ_h s$)
3. Since $s$ is the first student to be rejected, $s'$ has not been rejected by $\text{best}(s')$ yet, hence $h \succcurlyeq_{s'} \text{best}(s')$
4. By definition of $\text{best}(s)$, there exists another matching $M'$ where $s$ is matched to $h$
5. Suppose $s'$ is matched to $h'' \neq h$ in $M'$, we have $h'' \preccurlyeq_{s'} \text{best}(s') \preccurlyeq_{s'} h$, so $h'' \prec_{s'} h$
6. From point 2, $s' \succ_h s$, therefore $(s', h)$ forms a blocking pair in $M'$
7. This contradicts point 4

To prove that algorithm assigns $h \in H$ to $\text{worst}(h)$:

1. Assume that this is not the case, let $h$ matched to $s'$ instead of $s = \text{worst}(h)$
2. We know that $h = \text{best}(s')$ and $s' \succ_h \text{worst}(h)$
3. By definition of $\text{worst}(h)$, there exists another matching $M'$ where $h$ is matched to $s = \text{worst}(h)$
4. Suppose $s'$ is matched to $h' \neq h$ in $M'$
5. Since $h = \text{best}(s')$ $(s', h)$ forms a blocking pair in $M'$
6. This contradicts point 3

#### • Nash Bargaining Solution

$S$: convex, compact set

* Context: connect two dots in plane, resulting line still in plane
* Compact: close and bounded

If $(x, y) \in S$, then players get $x$ and $y$

Otherwise, players get $d_1$ and $d_2$

##### Pareto Optimality

$(x_1, y_1)$ Pareto dominates $(x_2, y_2)$ if $x_1 \geq x_2$, $y_1 \geq y_2$ and at least of the inequalities is strict

$(x, y)$ is Pareto optimal if it is not Pareto dominated by any other outcome

##### Nash Bargaining Solution

$\max(v_1 - d_1)(v_2 - d_2)$ such that $(v_1, v_2) \in S$

$\displaystyle \max \prod_i u_i(A)$

Nash bargaining solution is the only solution that satisfies

1. Efficiency

   No outcome Pareto dominates the solution

2. Symmetry

   If the roles are flipped, the solution will be reflected against $y = x$

3. Independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA)

   If we remove some region, outcome is still the same

4. invariance under equivalent representations (IER)

##### Utilitarian

The default social welfare

$\displaystyle \max \sum_i u_i(A)$

##### Egalitarian

"Santa Claus"

$\displaystyle \max\min_i u_i(A)$

##### Lagrange Multipliers

Goal: maximise $f \left( \vec{x} \right)$ such that $g\left(\vec{x}\right) = 0$

1. Write $L\left(\vec{x}, \lambda\right) = f\left(\vec{x}\right) - \lambda g\left(\vec{x}\right)$

2. Differentiate $L$ to all variables as well as $\lambda$, i.e.:

   $\displaystyle\frac{\partial L\left(\vec{x}, \lambda\right)}{\partial x_i} = \frac{\partial f\left(\vec{x}\right)}{\partial x_i} - \lambda \frac{\partial g \left(\vec{x}\right)}{\partial x_i}$

   $\displaystyle\frac{\partial L\left(\vec{x}, \lambda\right)}{\partial \lambda} = -g(\vec{x})$

3. Set all differentials to $0$

## Lecture 08: Fair Allocation of Indivisible Goods

#### • Definitions

Players: $N = \{1, \dots, n\}$

Indivisible goods: $G  = \{g_1, \dots, g_m\}$

Valuations: $v_i(g)$, player $i$'s value for good $g$

Valuations are additive i.e. $\forall G' \subseteq G, \, v_i(G') = \sum_{g \in G'}v_i(g)$

Allocation: $A = (A_1, \dots, A_n)$, partition of goods

##### Fairness Properties

1. Proportionality: $\displaystyle v_i(A_i) \geq \frac{1}{n} \cdot v_i(G)$
2. Envy-freeness: $v_i(A_i) \geq v_i(A_j)$

Proportionality / Envy-freeness cannot always be satisfied

For $n = 2$, envy-freeness $\equiv$ proportionality

For $n \geq 3$, envy-freeness is stronger than proportionality

* Envy-freeness $\Rightarrow$ proportionality

  If $v_i(A_i) \geq v_i(A_j)$

  Then $n \cdot v_i(A_i) \geq v_i(A_1) + \dots + v_i(A_n) = v_i(G)$

* Proportionality $\not \Rightarrow$ envy-freeness

  Counter-example:

  Player 1 has value 1 for all goods, others have value 0 for all goods

  $A_1 = \{g_1\}, \, A_2 = \{g_2, \dots, g_m\}$, others empty

##### EF1 vs EFX

* EF1: envy-freeness up to one good

  If $A_j \neq \emptyset$, $\exists g \in A_j$ such that $v_i(A_i) \geq v_i(A_j \backslash \{g\})$

* EFX: envy-freeness up to any good

  If $A_j \neq \emptyset$, $\forall g \in A_j$, $v_i(A_i) \geq v_i(A_j \backslash \{g\})$

Envy-freeness $\succ$ EFX $\succ$ EF1

EFX allocation always exists when $n = 2$ by "cut-and-choose"

1. The first player divides goods into two bundles that are as equal as possible
2. The second player chooses the bundle that he prefers
3. First player will be EFX, second player will be envy-free

EFX allocation always exists when $n = 3$ as well

#### • Algorithms

##### Maximum Utilitarian Welfare

Give each good to player who has the highest value for it, break ties arbitrarily

May fail EF1

##### Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW)

Maximises $\displaystyle \prod_{i = 1}^n v_i(M_i)$

Satisfies EF1

1. Suppose for contradiction that $i$ envies $j$ even after removal of one good
2. Consider a $g \in A_j$ that minimises $v_j(g) / v_i(g)$
3. Moving $g$ to $i$'s bundle increases Nash welfare (algebra omitted)

Resulting allocation is Pareto optimal

##### Maximin Share (MMS)

Relaxation of proportionality, $\displaystyle \text{MMS}_i \leq \frac{v_i(G)}{n}$

Player divides goods into $n$ bundles to maximise the value of minimum-value bundle

Allocation that gives everyone $\geq \text{MMS}$ always exists when $n = 2$ by "cut-and-choose"

Allocation might not exist for $n \geq 3$

But we can always give everyone $\displaystyle \geq \frac{3}{4}\text{MMS}$

##### Round-Robin

Players take turns choosing their favourite good from the remaining goods

Satisfies EF1

* If $i$ is ahead of $j$, $i$ does not envy $j$ in every round
* If $i$ is behind $j$, we consider first round to start with $i$'s first pick, $i$ does not envy $j$ up to $j$'s first good

##### Envy-Cycle Elimination

Applies to monotonic valuations ($\forall S \subseteq T \subseteq G, \, v_i(S) \leq v_i(T)$)

1. Allocate one good at a time in arbitrary order
2. Maintain envy graph with players as vertices, directed edge $i \to j$ iff $i$ envies $j$
3. At each step, the next good is allotted to player with no incoming edge
4. If there is a cycle, eliminate it by giving $A_j$ to $i$ for any $i \to j$

Claims:

1. At each step, procedure of eliminating cycle must end

   When we eliminate, utilitarian welfare increases

   But welfare cannot increase indefinitely

2. At the start of each round, there is an unenvied player

   Otherwise, there will be a cycle

3. At each step, the partial allocation is EF1

   We allocate a good to unenvied player, any envy is by at most one good

#### • Query Complexity

$O(mn)$ queries for envy-cycle elimination with monotonic valuations

* Suffices to query value of each agent for $n$ bundles in each partial allocation to construct envy graph
* $m$ partial allocation since we have $m$ goods

$O(\log m)$ for two agents with monotonic valuations

* Arrange goods on a line and implement cut-and-choose
* First agent can find EF1 using binary search

$\Omega(\log m)$ for any deterministic EF1 algorithm

$\Omega(c^m)$ for any deterministic EFX algorithm

## Lecture 09: Cake Cutting

#### • Definitions

Cake: interval $[0, 1]$

Agents: $N = \{1, \dots, n\}$

Valuation functions: $\{v_1, \dots, v_n\}$, area under density function is value

1. Nonnegative: no bad cake
2. Additive: values of disjoint pieces add up
3. Non-atomic: value of any single point is 0
4. Normalised: value of the whole cake is 1

Allocation: $A = (A_1, \dots, A_n)$, each being a union of finitely many intervals

##### Fairness Properties

1. Proportionality: $\displaystyle v_i(A_i) \geq \frac{1}{n}$
2. Envy-freeness: $v_i(A_i) \geq v_i(A_j)$

For $n = 2$, envy-freeness $\equiv$ proportionality

For $n \geq 3$, envy-freeness is stronger than proportionality

"Cut-and-choose" satisfies envy-freeness for $n = 2$

##### Robertson-Webb Model

Two types of queries:

1. $\text{Eval}_i(x, y)$: value of agent $i$ for interval $[x, y]$
2. $\text{Cut}_i(x, \alpha)$: leftmost point $y$ such that $v_i(x, y) = \alpha$

We need two queries for cut-and-choose

#### • Protocols

##### Dubins-Spanier Protocol

Achieves proportionality with $O(n^2)$ queries

Everyone gets a connected piece of cake

1. Referee moves knife over the cake starting from left
2. When the piece to the left of knife is worth $1/n$ to some agent, agent stops and leaves the procedure
3. Last agent gets the remaining cake

##### Even-Paz Protocol

Achieves proportionality with $O(\log n)$ queries

Assume $n$ is power of 2

1. Each agent marks the point that divides the cake into two halves of equal value
2. Let $t$ be mark number $n/2$ from the left
3. Recurse $[0, t]$ for the left $n/2$ agents, and $[t, 1]$ for the right $n/2$ agents
4. When we are down to one agent, the agent gets the whole cake

After $k^{\text{th}}$ cut, $n / 2^k$ agent are sharing a cake for which each of them has value at least $1 / 2^k$

Optimal among all proportional protocols, even if allocation is not required to be connected

##### Selfridge-Conway Protocol

Achieves envy-freeness for 3 agents with 5 cuts and 9 queries

1. Agent 1 divides cake into three equal pieces
2. If agent 2 and 3 prefer different pieces, we are done
3. Else, agent 2 is asked to trim the preferred piece so that it has equal value as the un-preferred piece
4. Trimmed piece is cut further and allocated

##### Envy-Freeness Approximation Protocol

Follows Dubins-Spanier, agent stops when the piece is worth $1/3$

Suppose knife reaches the right end but some cake is still unallocated:

1. There are still agents left, remaining cake given to any arbitrary agent
2. There is no agent left, remaining cake given to the agent who received last piece

To prove that agent envies by at most $1/3$:

1. If agent receives in stage 1, max envy = $2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3$
2. If agent did not receive in stage 1, no one got more than $1/3$ with his evaluation

#### • Truthfulness

Yes for the chooser, no for the cutter

Suppose chooser uniform, cutter prefers one side, cutter may manipulate by cutting a bigger chunk for himself

##### Truthful Mechanism for Piecewise Uniform Valuations

Density function takes only $0$ or $s_i$ for each agent

1. Agent 1 starts at left end, agent 2 starts at right end
2. Each agent eats his desired part at the same speed until they meet
3. Any part that an agent jumps over goes to the other agent

## Lecture 10: Rent Division

Input:

1. Roomates: $N = \{1, \dots, n\}$
2. Price for the whole apartment: $r$
3. Roomate $i$'s value of room $j$: $v_{ij}, \, \sum_j v_{ij} = r$

Output:

1. Room allocation: $\sigma: N \to N$
2. Rent division: $\vec{p} = (p_1, \dots, p_n), \, \sum_j p_j = r$

##### Envy-Free Outcome

$\langle \sigma, \vec{p} \rangle$ such that $u_i(\vec{p}) \geq v_{ij} - p_j, \, u_i(\vec{p}) = v_{i\sigma(i)} - p_{\sigma(i)}$

I do not prefer your room for the price you are being charged

Under EF constraint:

1. Equitability

   $\displaystyle D(\vec{p}) = \max_{i, j \in N}(u_i(\vec{p}) - u_j(\vec{p}))$

   Find $\min D(\vec{p})$ such that $\vec{p}$ is EF

2. Maximin

   $U(\vec{p}) = \min u_i(\vec{p})$

   Find $\max U(\vec{p})$ such that $\vec{p}$ is EF

There is a unique maxim price vector, and it is also equitable

However, there exists equitable price vectors that are not maximin

## Lecture 11: Committee Voting

Types of ballots:

* Ranking: submit ordering of candidates
* Score: submit number for candidates
* Approval: submit subset of candidates

Output of voting:

* Single-winner
* Multiwinner/committee
* Ranked committees

#### • Definitions

Approval committee voting

Voters: $N = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$

Candidates: $|C| = m$

Voter $i$ approves set of candidates $A_i \subseteq C$

Winners: $|W| = k \leq m$

Voter $i$'s utility: $u_i(W) = |A_i \cap W|$

#### • Justifiability

##### Justified Representation (JR)

Cohesive group: $S \subseteq N, \, |S| \geq n/k \land \left|\bigcap_{i \in S}A_i\right| \geq 1$

For any cohesive group, $\exists i \in S$ such that $|A_i \cap W| \neq \emptyset$

##### Extended Justified Representation (EJR)

$t$-cohesive group: $S \subseteq N, \, |S| \geq t \cdot (n / k) \land \left|\bigcap_{i \in S} A_i\right| \geq t$

For cohesive group, $t = 1$

For any $t$-cohesive group, $\exists i \in S$ such that $|A_i \cap W| \geq t$

#### • Mechanisms

##### Approval Voting (AV)

Maximise social welfare (total number of approval obtained)

Fails JR

##### Chamberlin-Courant (CC)

Maximise coverage (number of voters who approve at least one member)

NP hard problem

To prove that CC always satisfies JR:

1. Suppose for contradiction that it does not
2. Let $S$ be the unrepresented cohesive group, let $x$ be approved by all voters in $S$
3. Consider marginal contribution of $w \in W$ to coverage
4. Since coverage of $W < n$, some $w^\ast \in W$ has marginal contribution less than $n / k$
5. Remove $w^\ast$ and add $x$ for higher coverage, contradiction

##### Greedy CC

1. Start with empty set of candidates
2. In each step, select a candidate that covers the most uncovered voters

To prove that greedy CC satisfies JR:

1. Suppose for contradiction that it does not
2. Let $S$ be the unrepresented cohesive group, let $x$ be approved by all voters in $S$
3. Adding $x$ would have additional coverage of at least $n/k$
4. If greedy CC did not select $x$, it must have selected with a better candidate with coverage $\geq n/k$
5. Total coverage of $W \geq (n/k) \cdot k = n$, contradiction

##### Proportional Approval Voting (PAV)

Thiele method: choose $W$ to maximise:

$\displaystyle \sum_{i \in N}\left(s_1 + s_2 + \dots + s_{u_i(W)}\right)$ (sum of $u_i(W)$ terms)

AV (utilitarian): $\forall i, \, s_i = 1$

CC (somewhat egalitarian): $s_1 = 1, \, s2 = s_3 = \dots = 0$

PAV (somewhat Nash): $\forall i, \, s_i = 1/i$, harmonic number

$H_r = 1 + 1/2 + \dots + 1/r \approx \ln r$ 

Maximising $\sum_{i \in N} \ln (u_i(W))$ is the same as maximising $\prod_{i \in N} u_i(W)$

However, we should still use PAV over Nash

To prove that PAV satisfies EJR:

1. Suppose for contradiction that it does not
2. Let $S$ be the $t$-cohesive group, $u_i(W) < t$, let $x$ be approved by all voters in $S$ but not included in $W$
3. By adding $x$ to $W$, PAV score increases at least $\displaystyle \frac{1}{t} \cdot \frac{tn}{k} = \frac{n}{k}$
4. There is a candidate $y \in W$ such that its removal decreases the PAV score by $\displaystyle \leq n /k$

Greedy variant of PAV does not even satisfy JR

##### Method of Equal Shares (MES)

1. Each voter has budget $k/n$, each candidate costs $1$, voters pool their money to add candidate to committee
2. In each round, add a candidate whose approved voters have budget $\geq 1$ left
3. If there are several such candidates, choose one to minimise the maximise amount any agent has to pay
4. If no more candidate can be afforded, fill in the rest with tie-breaking criterion e.g. approval score

MES never chooses more than $k$ candidates since total budget is $k$

To prove that MES satisfy EJR:

1. Suppose for contradiction that it does not
2. Let $S$ be the $t$-cohesive group, $u_i(W) < t$
3. When MES stops, some $i \in S$ must have budget $\displaystyle < \frac{k}{tn}$ left, otherwise they should have pooled and bought a candidate
4. $i$ has used $\displaystyle > \frac{k}{n} - \frac{k}{tn} = \frac{(t - 1)k}{tn}$, and since $i$ chose at most $t - 1$ candidates so far, $i$ must have paid more than $\displaystyle \frac{k}{tn}$ on one candidate, let this first candidate be $x$
5. Each voter in $S$ will hence have budget $\displaystyle > \frac{k}{n} - (t - 1) \cdot \frac{k}{tn} = \frac{k}{tn}$
6. Since they pool the cost, no voter should have paid more than $\displaystyle \frac{k}{tn}$, contradiction

| CC        | ✅    | ❌    | ❌        |
| Greedy CC | ✅    | ❌    | ✅        |
| PAV       | ✅    | ✅    | ❌        |

## Lecture 12: Tournaments

#### • Definitions

Tournament: $T = (A, \succ)$, alternatives and dominance relation

For every pair of alternatives, exactly one dominates the other

Condorcet winner: alternative with out-degree $n - 1$

Condorcet loser: alternative with out-degree $0$

#### • Solutions

Returns a nonempty subset of alternatives

Invariant under isomorphisms, in a cyclic tournament of size 3, every solution must select all alternatives

1. Copeland set (CO)

   Alternatives with the highest out-degree

2. Top cycle (TC)

   1. Alternatives that can reach every other alternative
   2. Unique smallest nonempty set such that all alternatives in the set dominate all alternatives outside the set

3. Uncovered set (UC)

   1. Alternatives that can reach every other alternative via a path of length $\leq 2$
   2. The set of all uncovered alternatives ($x$ covers $y$ if $x \succ y$ and $\forall z, \, y \succ z \Rightarrow x \succ z$)

4. Banks set (BA)

   Alternatives that are maximal elements in some transitive sub-tournament that cannot be extended

   (able to arrange $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k$ such that $\forall i < j, a_i \succ a_j$)

5. Trivial (TRIV)

   All alternatives

6. Slater set (SL)

   Alternatives that are maximal elements in some transitive sub-tournaments that can be obtained by inverting as few edges as possible

7. Bipartisan set (BP)

   Alternatives chosen with nonzero probability in the Nash equilibrium of zero-sum game

8. Markov set (MC)

   Alternatives that stay most often in the "winner stays" competition

#### • Containment

1. $\text{UC} \subseteq \text{TC}$

   Valid by definition

2. $\text{CO} \subseteq \text{UC}$

   Let $x \in \text{CO}$, suppose $y$ covers $x$, then $y$ must have a higher out-degree than $x$, contradiction

3. $\text{BA} \subseteq \text{UC}$

   Let $x \in \text{BA}$, suppose $T'$ is the sub-tournament that cannot be extended

   Suppose $y$ cover $x$, $y$ can extend $x$, contradiction

#### • Axioms

CO, BA, UC, TC satisfy both axioms

1. Condorcet-consistency

   If there is a Condorcet winner $x$, then $x$ is uniquely chosen

2. Monotonicity

   If $x$ is chosen, it should remain chosen when it is strengthened against another alternative $y$

#### • Tournament Fixing Problem

Alternative is knockout winner if it wins a balanced knockout tournament

TFP: is there a bracket for balanced knockout tournament where our favourite alternative wins?

##### Strong Kings

Let $x \in \text{UC}$ be a king, suppose $x$ beats $P$ and loses to $Q$

If $|P| \geq n/2$, $x$ is a knockout winner

Base case: $n = 2$, trivial case

Induction:

1. Find a maximum matching from $P$ to $Q$
2. Match $x$ to any player in $P$
3. Match players within $P$ and within $Q$ arbitrarily
4. If necessary, match remaining pair from $Q$ to $P$

Therefore, any alternative in CO is a knockout winner
