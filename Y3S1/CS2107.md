## Lecture 00: Introduction

**Security requirments**:

* Confidentiality: viewing / disclosure
* Integrity: modification
* Availability: usage / withholding

## Lecture 01: Encryption

### § 1.1 Definitions

**• Cryptography**: study of techniques in securing communication in the presence of adversaries

**• Encryption scheme (cipher)**: encryption and decryption

Requirements:

1. Correctness: for any plaintext $x$ and key $k$, $D_k(E_k(x)) = x$
2. Security: given a cipher text, it is difficult to derive useful information
3. Performance (optional)

**• Symmetric crypto-systems**: identical encryption & decryption keys

### § 1.2 Classical Ciphers

Not secure in the computer era

Key space: set of all possible keys

Key space size: total number of possible keys

Key length: number of bits required to represent a key

#### • Substitution Cipher

Plaintext & ciphertext: string over a set of symbols $U$

Key: 1-1 onto function from $U$ to $U$

Attacker's goal:

1. Find the key
2. Obtain information about plaintext

**Exhaustive search attack**: brute force to examine all possible keys

##### • Known-plaintext scenario

Iterate until ciphertext matches plaintext

For sufficiently long ciphertext, full table can be determined

Substitution cipher insecure under known-plaintext attacks

##### • Ciphertext-only scenario

Iterate until plaintext contains words in English dictionary

Negligible probability that algorithm finds a wrong key

Vulnerable to frequency analysis: map frequent letters in cipher text to frequent letters in English

#### • Permutation Cipher

1. Groups plaintext into blocks of $t$
2. Applies permutation to characters in each block

Known-plaintext and ciphertext-only scenario: same as substitution cipher

#### • One-Time Pad

$n$-bit plaintext, $n$-bit key

Encryption: $p \oplus k \to c$

Dncryption: $c \oplus k \to p$

Attacker can derive key from a pair of plaintext and ciphertext, but key is useless

Leaks no information except length, cipher is unbreakable

### § 1.3 Attack Model

##### Attacker's Capabilities

|                       | Observe Ciphertexts | Know Plaintexts | Perform Encryption | Perform Decryption |
| --------------------- | :-----------------: | :-------------: | :----------------: | :----------------: |
| **Ciphertext Only**   |          ✅          |        ❌        |         ❌          |         ❌          |
| **Known Plaintext**   |          ✅          |        ✅        |         ❌          |         ❌          |
| **Chosen Plaintext**  |          ✅          |        ✅        |         ✅          |         ❌          |
| **Chosen Ciphertext** |          ✅          |        ✅        |         ✅          |         ✅          |

##### Attacker's Goals

* Total break: find the key
* Partial break: recover plaintext from ciphertext, determine coarse information
* Indistiguishability

##### Usefulness

System $S_1$ more secure on system $S_2$ if some attack successful on $S_1$ but $S_2$ prevents all attacks

Cipher should prevent attacker's weakest goal under strongest capability (i.e. indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack)

### § 1.4 Modern Ciphers

#### • Stream Cipher

**Encryption**:

* Choose a psuedorandom initialisation vector (IV)
* Generate sequence from key and IV
* Use sequence as one-time pad
* Prepend IV to ciphertext

**Decrption**:

* Extract IV

**Role of IV**:

If same key is used: $U = X \oplus K, V = Y \oplus K$

$U \oplus V = X \oplus Y$, cancels effect of pseudorandom sequences

Make encrption non-deterministic

#### • Block Cipher

$n$-bit block size, $s$-bit key size

The longer the key, the more secure the scheme, the slower it is

Block cipher is an iteration of rounds

Popular block ciphers:

1. Data Encryption Standard (DES), 64-bit block, 56-bit key
2. Advanced Encryption System (AES), 128-bit block, varying size key

|            | Stream                                            | Block                               |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| $\bold{+}$ | Fast, low error propagation                       | High diffusion, immune to insertion |
| $\bold{-}$ | Low difusion, susceptible to malicious insertions | Slow, Padding required              |

**Diffusion**:

Change in plaintext affects many parts of ciphertext

Requires attacker to access much of ciphertext to infer encryption algorithm

**Confusion**:

Not able to predict what happens to ciphertext when plaintext or key changes

Input undergoes complex transformation

**Modes of Operation**:

Method to extend block cipher to arbitrary long plaintext

1. Electronic Code Book (ECB)

   Apply block repeatedly

   Insecure as identical blocks can be identified

   Remedy: employ AES with randomly chosen IV, cipher becomes probabilistic

2. Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)

   $c_0 = \text{IV}, c_i = E_k(p_i \oplus c_{i - 1})$

3. Counter (CTR)

   $c_0 = \text{IV}, c_i = p_i \oplus E_k(\text{IV} + i)$

   Turns block cipher to stream cipher

### § 1.5 Examples of Attacks

#### • Meet-in-the-Middle Attack

2DES: use $k_1, k_2$ to encrypt twice,

Expected strength: 112 bits	Actual strength: 57 bits

Given $c$ and $m$, to find $k_1$ and $k_2$:

1. Compute set $C$: ciphertexts of $m$ with all possible keys
2. Compute set $M$: plaintexts of $c$ with all possible keys
3. Find common element in $C$ and $M$

For $k$-bit keys: space $2^{k + 1}$, crypto operations $2^{k + 1}$

#### • Padding Oracle Attack

Attacker has:

* Ciphertext which includes IV $(\text{IV}, c)$

* Access to padding oracle

  Follows PKCS#7

  Accepts a ciphertext as query

  Yes if corresponding plaintext has correct padding

  No otherwise

* No knowledge of key $k$

Attacker's goal:

* Obtain plaintext

Attack steps: 

1. Attacker has $(\text{IV}, c)$ and knows the block is padded with 3 bytes, and block size is 8 bytes

2. For $\texttt{a}$ in $\texttt{00...FF}$:

   1. Let $\text{IV}' = \text{IV} \oplus \texttt{00 00 00 00 a 07 07 07}$

      Note: $\texttt{07} = \texttt{04} \oplus \texttt{03}$

   2. Send result to padding oracle

   3. If oracle gives yes, then output $\texttt{04} \oplus \texttt{a}$ as the 5th byte


### § 1.6 Cryptography Pitfalls

1. Reusing IV & one-time pad key

2. Predictable secret generation (`srand` & `rand`)

3. Design own cipher

4. Disregarding Kerckhoffs' Principle

   A system should be secure even if everything except the secret key is public knowledge

## Lecture 02: Entity Authentication

### § 2.1 Definitions

Types of authentication:

* Entity authentication: communicating entity is involved in a connection
* Data-origin authentication: communicating entity is the origin of a piece of information

Data-origin authenticity implies data integrity

Data integrity does NOT imply data-origin authenticity

### § 2.2 Password

Identity does not need to be kept secret, password is a secret

| Process        | Provided By | Uniqueness |
| -------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Identification | Principal   | Yes        |
| Authentication | Principal   | No         |
| Authorisation  | System      | -          |

#### • Password Authentication System

##### Stage 1: Bootstrapping

* Server / user chooses a password
* Default password

##### Stage 2: Authentication

Weak authentication: subject to replay attack

Strong authentication: information sniffed can't be used to impersonate the user

##### Stage 3: Password reset

* Anyone who knows old password can change
* Entity presents additionally document/information

#### • Searching for Password

##### Password Guessing

1. Online guessing: attacker interacts with authentication system
2. Offline guessing: attacker obtains password 

##### Password Attack

1. Exhaustive search: try all combinations
2. Dictionary attack: restrict to probably passwords
3. Hybrid attack

#### • Stealing the Password

1. Eavesdropping (shoulder surfing / sniffing / keylogger)
2. Login spoofing
3. Phishing
4. Password caching
5. Insider attack

#### • Preventive Measures

1. Phishing protection: repository sites / filtering 

2. Use strong password, high entropy

   Entropy: $\log_2N$ bits

   Secure against online attacks: 29 bits

   RFC 4086: 96 bits	NIST: 128 bits

   Case insensitive/sensitive alphabet: 4.700/5.700 bits

   Case insensitive/sensitive alphanum: 5.170/5.954 bits

3. Password protection: ageing / usage policy

4. Hashed password, use salt to hash into two different values

#### • Password Reset

1. Security questions

   Enhanced usability, reduced cost, but weakening security

   Answer to security questions: safe, memorable, universal, consistent

2. Recovery email address

   OTP

### § 2.3 Biometrics

Enrolment: store reference template

Verification: matching algorithm

| Password                    | Biometrics           |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Can be changed              | Cannot be changed    |
| Need to remember            | Don't have to        |
| 0 non-matched rate          | Probability of error |
| Can pass password to others | Not possible         |

$\displaystyle \text{False Match Rate} = \frac{\text{successful false}}{\text{attempted false}}$

$\displaystyle \text{False Non-Match Rate} = \frac{\text{rejected genuine}}{\text{attempted genuine}}$

Equal error rate: when FNMR = FMR

Failure-to-enrol rate: users' data can't be captured

Failure-to-capture rate: users' data fail to be captured during authentication

## Lecture 03: Authenticity

### § 3.1 Public-Key Cryptography

##### Requirements

Given the public key and ciphertext, but without the private key, it is difficult to determine the plaintext (indistinguishability of ciphertext)

Requirement implies that difficult to get private key from the public key

##### Advantages

$A_i$ wants to encrypt message for $A_j$

Symmetric-key setting: pairwise secure channels needed

Total number of keys: $n(n-1)/2$

Public-key setting: one secure broadcast channel needed

Total number of public keys: $n$

Total number of private keys: $n$

#### • RSA

##### Set-up

1. Randomly choose 2 large primes $p, q$ and computes $n = pq$
2. Randomly choose encryption exponent $e$ such that $\gcd(e, \phi(n)) = 1$, where $\phi(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1)$
3. Determine decryption exponent $d$ such that $d \cdot e \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n)$
4. Publish $(n, e)$ as public key and keep $(n, d)$ as private key

##### Encryption & Decryption

Encryption: $c = m^e \mod n$	Decryption: $m = c^d \mod n$

Difficult to derive $d$ from $n$ and $e$

RSA is correct since $(m^e)^d \equiv m \mod n$

Interchangeable: can use decryption key to encrypt and encryption key to decrypt

##### Pitfalls

1. Efficiency & Performance

   Significantly slower than AES

   Remedy: hybrid encryption, encrypt AES' key with RSA

2. ECB with RSA

   Deterministic encryption, information can be leaked

3. Not necessarily more secure than AES

   Getting $d$ from $(n, e)$ is as difficult as factorisation, but getting $m$ from $c$ and $(n, e)$ might not be

   Factorisation can be efficiently done by a quantum computer

### § 3.2 Unkeyed Hash (Integrity)

Takes arbitrarily long message as input, output a fixed-size digest

##### Requirements

1. Efficiency

2. Pre-image resistance

   Computationally infeasible to find $m$ such that $h(m_1) = y$

3. Collision resistance

   Computationally infeasible to find $(m_1, m_2)$ such that $h(m_1) = h(m_2)$

Collision resistance implies pre-image resistance

##### Usage for Integrity

Assume there's a secure channel to send a short piece of information

1. Let $F$ be the original file

2. Obtain digest $h(F)$ from secure channel

3. Obtain $F'$ whose origin claims that file is $F$

4. Compare two digests $h(F)$ and $h(F')$

   If $h(F) = h(F')$, $F = F'$ with high probability

### § 3.3 MAC/Keyed Hash (Authenticity)

Takes arbitrarily long message as input, output a fixed-size digest

Correct MAC can only be generated by someone who knows the key

##### Requirements

After seeing multiple valid pairs of messages & MACs, it's difficult to forge MAC of a message not seen before

##### Usage for Authenticity

1. Let $F$ be the original file
2. Obtain key $k$ from secure channel
3. Obtain file $F'$ and MAC $t$ from insecure channel
4. Compare two digests $\text{MAC}_k(F')$ and $t$

Even when MAC is modified by attacker, it can be detected with high probability

MAC is typically appended to $F$ as a single file to act as authentication tag

### § 3.4 Signature (Integrity)

Public-key / asymmetric version of MAC

##### Requirements

Without knowing $k_{\text{pri}}$, it is difficult to forge signature

##### Usage for Authenticity

1. Let $F$ be the original file
2. Sign $F$ with $k_{\text{pri}}$ to get signature $s$
3. Obtain file $F'$ and $s$ from insecure channel
4. Verify $F'$ with $k_{\text{pub}}$ to get signature $s'$
5. Compare $s$ and $s'$

##### Advantages

* No one except the authentic signer can forge signature
* Achieves non-repudiation (cannot deny previous actions)

##### Design of Signature Scheme

1. Unkeyed hash + sign/verify algorithm
2. RSA-based, signature is encrypted digest from unkeyed hash

### § 3.5 Attacks & Pitfalls

##### Birthday Attack

All hash functions subjected to birthday attack

$M > 1.17 \times T^{0.5}$: collision with probability more than 0.5

$\displaystyle P(\text{collision}) = 1-\exp\left(\frac{-M^2}{2T}\right)$

Consequence on digest length: when key length for a symmetric key is $n$, recommended digest length is $2n$

##### Misuse of Encryption

False sense of security

Encryption only provides confidentiality, but does not guarantee integrity and authenticity

## Lecture 04: Public Key Infrastructure & Channel Security

### § 4.1 Public Key Distribution

Secret key not required to be sent via secure channel

Yet, public key still needs to be sent securely

##### Distribution Methods

1. Announcement

   But not standardised, need to trust entity

2. Directory: query server

   But anyone can post, need to trust entity, serve is performance bottleneck

3. PKI

   Make public-key cryptography deployable on a large scale

   Make public keys verifiable without requiring trust for each other

   Mange public & private key pairs throughout their lifecycle

### § 4.2 Public Key Infrastructure

##### Certificate Authority

Issues and signs digital certificate, has its own public-private key pair

Binds an entity with his/her public key prior to verification point

OS and browsers have pre-loaded CAs' public keys

##### Certificate

Digital document that contains at least:

1. Identity of owner
2. Public key of owner
3. Time window for certificate validity
4. Signature of CA

Standard: X.509

#### • CA & Trust Relationship

##### Types of CA Validation

* Domain validation: purchaser has the right to manage a domain name
* Organisation validation: purchaser has organisation as a legal entity
* Extended validation: manual verification checks

##### Types of CA

* Root (self-signed)
* Sub-ordinate / Intermediate (tier 1/2)

##### Certification Chain

Trust inference works in hierarchy of trust

* Start with end-entity certificate
* Followed by one or more certificates
* Last one being root CA certificate

For each certificate:

* Issuer must match subject of next certificate
* Signed by private key of the next certificate

#### • Certificate Revocation

Non-expired certificates can be revoked, verifier needs to check validity by:

* Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
* Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)

OSCP problems:

1. Privacy: OCSP responder knows certificate you are validating
2. Soft-fail validation: browsers may proceed if no reply to OCSP request

Remedy at the expense of network cost:

1. OCSP stapling: allow certificate to be accompanied by a response
2. Part of TLS handshake

### § 4.3 Limitations & Attacks

1. Compromised CAs

2. Abuse by CA

   Rogue CA can forge any certificate

3. Weak browser trust model

   Certification is only as strong as the weakest root CA

4. Implementation bugs (null-byte injection attack)

5. Social engineering (typosquatting)

   Register a typo-ed domain name with valid certificate

## Lecture 05: Authentication

### § 5.1 Strong Authentication

##### • SKC-Based Challenge-Response

1. Bob randomly picks $m$ and sends to Alice $y = E_k(m)$
2. Alice decrypt $y$ to get $m$ and send back to Bob
3. Bob verifies

Eve can't get $k$ even if she obtain all communication

However, protocol is unilateral and only authenticates Alice

##### • PKC-Based Challenge-Response

1. Bob randomly picks number $r$ and sends to Alice
2. Alice use private key to sign and sends $\text{sign}(r)$
3. Bob verifies

$r$ is likely to be different and is known as nonce

### § 5.2 Authenticated Key Exchange

After authentication, Mallory might interrupt and take over the channel

Authentication process thus must establish a session key $k$

##### • Unauthenticated Key Exchange with PKC

1. Alice generates private/public key
2. Alice sends public key $k_e$ to Bob
3. Bob does the following
   1. Randomly choose secret $k$
   2. Encrypt $k$ with $k_e$
   3. Send ciphertext to Alice
4. Alice uses private key $k_d$ to decrypt and obtain $k$

##### • Unauthenticated Key Exchange with Diffle-Hellman

1. Alice and Bob agree on 2 public parameters, generator $g$ and large prime $p$
2. Alice chooses random $a$, compute $x = g^a$, Bob chooses random $b$, compute $y = g^b$
3. Alice computes $k = y^a \text{ mod } p$, Bob computes $k = x^b \text{ mod } p$
4. Alice and Bob agree on $k = g^{ab} \text{ mod } p$

Steps 2 & 3 can be carried out in parallel

##### • Authenticated Key Exchange with Diffle-Hellman

Same as unauthenticated DH, but sign steps 2 & 3 with private key

### § 5.3 Securing Communication Channel

1. Authenticated key exchange

   Both Alice and Bob know session key $t$ and secret key of MAC $t$

2. Secure communication

   Communication is protected by $k$ and $t$

##### • Transport Layer Security (TLS)

1. Cipher negotiation
2. Authenticated key exchnage
3. Symmetric-key based secure communication
4. Renegotiation if needed

### § 5.4 Authenticated Encryption

Combines cipher and MAC to ensure confidentiality and authenticity

##### • Encrypt-and-MAC

Computes ciphertext $C$ and MAC $T$ separately, sends $(C, T)$

Issue: $T$ could leak out information

##### • MAC-then-Encrypt

First computes MAC $T$, then generates ciphertext $C$, sends $C$

Issue: decryption still needed on corrupted message

##### • Encrypt-then-MAC

First generates ciphertext $C$, then computes MAC $T$, sends $(C, T)$

Decryption is not performed on corrupted message

## Lecture 06: Network Security

##### Objectives of Network Security

1. Preserving confidentiality, integrity & authenticity
2. Maintaining availability
3. Managing & monitoring traffic flow

##### Challenges in Network Security

1. Complexity

   Nodes are owned by different semi-trusted parties

2. Legacy & security tradeoff

   Initial design might not consider intentional attacks

3. Additional security requirements

   E.g. routing integrity, accountability, anonymity

4. Possible host compromise

   Attacker at a certain layer can access all information at that layer and below

5. Management

   Need to isolate/control info flow and network access

### § 6.1 Network Layers

##### • Overview

Networking protocol consists of several layers

* Peer entities at the same layer communicate with protocol at that layer
* Layer $N-1$ provides services to entities in layer $N$
* At layer $N$: upper layer's protocol data unit (**PDU**) is encapsulated and sent

##### • TCP/IP Reference Model & Addressing schemes

A single node has different names at different layers

1. Physical
2. Data link: MAC address
3. Internet: IP address
4. Transport: port number
5. Application: domain name

##### • UDP

Connectionless-oriented & unreliable communication

Library construct the corresponding IP packet

$\texttt{[source IP|dest IP|source port|dest port|msg]}$

Limit on message size: ~65KB

##### • TCP/IP

Connection-oriented & reliable communication

Carry out 3-way handshake between two nodes

Has mechanism to re-transmit, re-order, acknowledge packets

Destination receive all messages in correct order

TCP is **NOT secure**, intermediate nodes can act as man-in-the-middle and modify data

### § 6.2 Name Resolution & Attacks

##### • Domain Name System (DNS)

Function: maps domain name to IP address

Find IP address by:

1. Looking up locally stored host table
2. Querying DNS server

Query process:

1. Each query contains 16-bit QID
2. Response from server must also contain QID
3. If QIDs do not match, client rejects the answer

No encryption is involved in query

##### • Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

Function: maps IP address to MAC address

Use a broadcast mechanism on local network

##### • Local DNS Attack

Setup:

* Attacker at physical layer / just below application layer
* Attacker can sniff & spoof data, but can't remove/modify data sent by Alice
* Attacker owns a web server, which is a spoofed website

Process:

1. Alice asks for address
2. Mallory sniffs and quickly spoofs a reply with same QID
3. Mallory is closer to Alice, hence Mallory's reply reach Alice first
4. Alice takes first reply as answer and connects to spoofed website

### § 6.3 Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

Attack on availability

|            | Stopping Service                                             | Exhausting Resources                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Local**  | Process killing<br />Process crashing<br />Process reconfiguring | Spawning processes<br />Filling up file system |
| **Remote** | Sending malformed packet                                     | Packet flooding                                |

##### • Smurf Flood Attack

1. Attacker sends `ICMP PING` to router, source IP address spoofed with victim's IP address
2. Router broadcast echo request to all local nodes
3. Each entity replies by sending echo reply to source
4. Victim overwhelmed with echo reply

Attack is no longer effective since most routers disabled broadcasts

##### • Application-Layer DoS Attack

Flood web server with HTTP requests

For its effectiveness, a large number of attackers are required

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): attacker plant trojan horse, zombies attack victim simultaneously

Example: Botnet

### § 6.4 Useful Network Security Tools

* Wireshark (packet analyser)
* nmap (port scanner)

### § 6.5 Protection

#### Using Cryptography

Different security protocols operate at different layers

Security protocol that protects layer $k$ would protect information from layer $\geq k$ against attacker sitting at layer $k-1$ and below

Some protections span across multiple layers, or do not provide full protection of targeted layer

##### • 1. TLS/SSL (Between layer 4 & 5)

Protects data using encryption (confidentiality) & MAC (authenticity)

End-to-end encryption

##### • 2. WPA2 (Layer 1 & 2)

Not all information in layer 2 is protected

##### • 3. IPSec (Layer 3)

Provides integrity/authenticity protection of IP addresses, but not confidentiality

#### Firewall

##### • Motivation

1. SSL/TLS & WPA2 not sufficient to protect network

   - Cannot prevent concerns of DoS

   - Many services & apps cannot be protected e.g. DNS spoofing

2. Need to control flow of traffic between untrusted public network and trusted internal network

3. Need to divide into segments and deny unnecessary access within internal network

   * Principle of least privilege: every module must be able to access only the information that are necessary for legitimate purpose
   * Compartmentalisation

##### • Setup

Sits at border between networks

Controls what traffic is allowed to enter (ingress filtering) or leave (egress filtering)

Demilitarised zone: small sub-network that exposes external service to untrusted internet

Configuration table processed in top-down manner, first matching rule determines action taken

##### Types of Firewall

1. Packet filters

   Filter based on information in packet headers

2. Stateful inspection

   Maintains state table for all connections

3. Application proxy

   Understands application logic

#### Network Security Management

1. Security operations centre
2. Security information and event management

## Lecture 07: Access Control

### § 7.1 Layering Model in Computer Systems

| Network                                     | Computer                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| More well-defined boundary                  | Less well-defined boundary (insightful to figure out at what layer the attack reside) |
| Concern about confidentiality and integrity | Concern about access and process integrity (whether deviates from original execution path) |

### § 7.2 Access Control

#### Definition

Provides way to specify & enforce restrictions of operations on objects by principals/subjects

* Principal: human that wants to access an object with some operation
* Subject: entity that wants to access an object with some operation
* Reference monitor: grants or denies the access
* Access: observe / alter / action
* Owner: Entity that decides the access rights
  * Discretionary access control (DAC): owner decides
  * Mandatory access control (MAC): system-wide policy

#### Access Control Matrix (ACM)

A matrix of principals and objects

Drawback: size of table/list can be very large

Solution: group the subjects/object with intermediate control

##### • Access Control List (ACL)

Each object has a list of access rights to it

Drawback: hard to find all accessible objects given a particular subject

##### • Capabilities

Each subject has a list of capabilities to objects

Drawback: hard to get an overview of subjects who have access to a particular object

### § 7.3 Intermediate Control

1. Groups

2. Privileges

3. Role-based access control (RBAC)

4. Protection rings

   Object & subject is assigned a number, smaller numbers have higher privilege

### § 7.4 Access Control in UNIX

#### User & Groups

ACL specifies user classes: user / group / others

Each user:

1. Has unique user/login name
2. Has unique UID
3. Can belong to one or more groups, first group stored in `/etc/passwd`, additional groups stored in `/etc/group`

Each group:

1. Has unique group name
2. Has unique GID

UIDs and GIDs

1. Determine ownership of system sources
2. Determine credentials of processes
3. Control permissions

#### Password File `/etc/passwd`

File is world readable since info is needed by non-root processes

Hashed password allows offline password guessing, currently replaced with `*`

Format: $\texttt{\$hash-method-id \$salt \$hashed-key}$

#### File System Permission

##### • Representation

1. Symbolic mode: $\texttt{-rwsr--r-x}$

   First bit: $\texttt{-}$ if file, $\texttt{d}$ if directory

   Triples: read, write, execute for user, group, others

2. Octal mode: $\texttt{4755}$

   3 or 4 digits

   3 rightmost digits: same as symbolic, convert 3 bits to octal

   Optional leading bit: specifies special file permissions

##### • Special File Permissions

1. Set-UID: process' effective UID is of executable owner
2. Set-GID: process' effective GID is of group owner
3. Sticky bit (`t`): file can only be deleted by the owner

##### • Permission Checking Rules

When a non-root subject wants to access an object

1. If user is owner, check permission bit of owner
2. If user is not owner, but user's group owns the file, check permission bit of group
3. If user is neither owner, nor member of group that owns the file, check permission bit of other

### § 7.5 Controlled Invocation

Sometimes, a non-root user needs resources that can be only accessed by superuser, but it is not advisable to promote privilege

Instead, we elevate privilege with predefined bridges, which are applications that carry out limited operations only

Drawback: bridges can contain exploitable vulnerability

#### In Unix

Process is associated with real UID and effective UID

If set-UID disabled: effective UID is real UID

If set-UID enabled: effective UID is file's owner

When user types command to execute program, it will be searched through directories specified in the search path

## Lecture 08: Software Security

### § 8.1 Overview & Background

##### • Posible Problems

1. Insecure implementation

2. Unanticipated input

   Attacker manages to elevate its privilege

   Access sensitive resources / Deviate from original execution path / Execute injected code

##### • Root Causes

1. Functionality
2. Human mistakes
3. Complex systems

##### • Code, Data & Program Counter

Programs may be tricked into treating input data as code

Direct jump: PC replaced with constant value

Indirect jump: PC replaced with value fetched from memory of a general purpose register

##### • Call Stack

Stores important information of running a process

Control flow information, parameters, local varibales

##### • Process Execution Integrity

If attacker has capability to write, he can:

1. Overwrite existing code

2. Overwrite control-flow information

   a. Replace memory location storing address for direct jump

   b. Replace memory location storing address for indirect jump

### § 8.2 Attacks on Software

##### • Integer Overflow

Integer arithmetic are actually modular, `a < a + 1` is not necessarily always true

##### • Buffer Overflow

C and C++ do not employ bound checks for efficiency and flexibility

Data buffer: contiguous region of memory used to temporarily store data

Buffer overflow happens when data is written beyond buffer's boundary

Examples:

1. `strcpy(s1, s2)`

   If `s2` is supplied by malicious user, input can overwrite memory and modify computation

   Remedy: use `strncpy(s1, s2, n)` instead

2. Stack smashing

   Special case that targets process' call stack

   Targets: data that controls process execution (e.g. return addresses, function pointers) and important program variables (e.g. credential-related)

##### • Data/String Representation

Different programs/systems adopts different representations, inconsistencies lead to vulnerability

1. Null-byte injection

   C's `printf` use null character to indicate end of the string

   CA may accept a host name containing null character

2. ASCII character encoding

   UTF-8: variable-length encoding, one to four bytes

   There can be longer variants of the same ASCII character in UTF-8, hard to verify

   E.g. use various bytes to represent `../`, normal input validation does not working due to variable length

3. IP address

   Program might extract 4 integers of 32-bit for IP address, use formula to calculate a resultant 32-bit IP address, possibility of overflowing

Remedy: never trust user input, always convert to canonical representation

##### • Undocumented Access Points

Backdoor: covert method of bypassing normal authentication

### § 8.3 Preventive Measures

1. Use safer functions

   `strncpy()` instead of `strcpy()`

2. Input validation using filtering

   Approaches: white list / black list

   Caveat: difficult to ensure filtering is complete

3. Bounds checking and type safety

   At runtime: if bound checking fail, halt the process

   Runtime / Compile time: dynamic / static type checking

4. Program analysis

   Manual / automated checking

   Taint analysis: variables that contain input labelled as source, critical functions labelled as sinks

5. Memory protection

   Canary: secret values inserted at selected memory location, checks carried out at runtime to make sure values are not modified

   Randomisation: randomly arrange address space positions of key data areas

6. Code testing

   White-box / Black-box / Grey-box

   Fuzzing: send malformed inputs to discover vulnerabilities

7. Principle of least privilege

   Conservative in elevating privilege when writing a program

   Do not give more rights / active unnecessary options when deploying a system

8. Patching

## Lecture 09: Web Security

### § 9.1 Background

##### • Web Page Access

1. User clicks on URL
2. HTTP request sent to server
3. Serve constructs and includes HTML file in HTTP response
4. Browser renders HTML

##### • JavaScript

1. Write text into HTML page
2. Read and change elements
3. React to events
4. Validate user data
5. Access cookies
6. Interact with the server

### § 9.2 Security Issues

1. Due to browser's operations

   Browsers run same privileges as user

   Multiple servers could provide content, access isolation is required

   Brosers has rich command set and controls

   Plugins, add-ons, extensions

2. Due to browser's usage

   Browsers keep user's sensitive information

   Browser is becoming the super application

### § 9.3 Threat Models

##### • Attacker as End Systems

Malicious web server / client

1. Forum poster

   User of an existing web app, weakest attacker type

2. Web attacker

   Owns valid domain and web server with certificate, entices victim to visit the site

##### • Attacker as MitM

Pre-conditions: attacker between browser and web server, attacker able to sniff & spoof packets

1. Passsive network attacker

   Eavesdrop network traffic

2. Active network attacker

   Launch attack, most powerful type

### § 9.4 UI Based Attacks

1. Homograph attack

   Use a domain name that is only a few pixels different

2. Hostname-and-path boundary confusion attack

   Use a hostname that contain targeted hostname followed by character resembling `/`

3. Address-bar spoofing attack

   Overlay a spoofed address bar on top

### § 9.5 Cookies

Stored on user's browser, browser automatically sends all in-scope cookies to server in its HTTP request

Based on cookie lifetime: session vs persistent

Based on cookie accessibility: secure vs HTTP-only

Usage: storing session ID with expiry date

1. After user authenticated, server sends unique unguessable session ID to user
2. Server keeps track of association between user and session ID
3. In subsequent requests, whoever presents session ID is accepted as authentic user

Threat: protect web objects from unwanted access, need access control policy

##### • Same Origin Policy

Script in webpage A can access cookies stored by webpage B only if both A and B have the same origin

Origin: combination of protocol, hostname, port number

### § 9.6 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks

Injection attack, can work despite enforcement of same origin policy

Forum poster/web attacker attacks another user by causing user to run a malicious script form an involved web server

Exploits victim's trust of server

##### • Reflected (Non-Persistent) Attack

Script embedded in URL parameter doesn't work due to HTML encoding

1. Attacker tricks user to click on a URL, which contains target website and malicious script
2. Request sent to server
3. Server constructs a response HTML, doesn't check request carefully and response contains script
4. Browser renders HTML and runs script
5. Script can now escalate privilege and access cookies

##### • Stored (Persistent) Attack

Script is stored in server

More dangerous than reflected as victim-to-script ratio is many-to-one

##### • Defence

Server filters, removes and sanitises malicious script in HTTP request or users' post

XSS auditor

### § 9.7 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attacks

Authorisation attack that disrupts integrity of user's session

Web attacker attacks another user by issuing a forged request to a vulnerable web serve on behalf of user

Exploits server's trust of client

##### • With User Action

1. Alice already authenticated by website with cookie
2. Bob tricks Alice to click on URL with malicious request
3. Alice's cookie will be automatically sent to website
4. Malicious request carried out by the website

##### • Without User Action

1. Alice already authenticated
2. Alice visits attacker's site that contains an image with URL
3. Browser issues another HTTP request to obtain image

##### • Defence

Server attaches an extra dynamic anti-CSRF token

### § 9.8 SQL Injection

Scripting language allows variable, user pass input string to modify script

Remedy: use prepared statements
